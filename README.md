## This is my personal python implementation for the coursework in ML taught by Andrew Ng.

I am a big python fan, and my goal is to master the materials in my favoriate language.

Note: Using python won't get you the certificate. If you need to get a certificate, please refer to the original materials for Octave or Matlab.

Note2: Mathematics requirements are higher if you use python rather than Matlab or Octave.
